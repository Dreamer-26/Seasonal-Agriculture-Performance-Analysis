## 🎯 Objective

This project analyzes seasonal agricultural performance and explores how environmental conditions, irrigation practices, resource usage, crop yield, profitability, and disease/pest risk vary across agricultural seasons.

### Analytical Questions

1. Which agricultural season delivers the highest average yield and profitability, and how stable are the profit distributions?
2. How do rainfall and temperature vary across seasons, and how are these environmental differences reflected in yield outcomes?
3. How does the interaction between irrigation method and season affect water efficiency and disease/pest risk?

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **4,000 farm-level records** and **28 features** covering:

- Farm, state, district, crop, and season information
- Rainfall, temperature, humidity, sunlight, soil pH, and soil moisture
- Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, fertilizer, pesticide, and seed quality
- Yield, production, market price, cost, revenue, and profit
- Water usage, water efficiency, and disease/pest risk

The source dataset is included in `data/` for reproducibility. fileciteturn71file0L2-L6

## 🔬 Analysis Workflow

1. Load and inspect the agricultural dataset.
2. Check structure, descriptive statistics, missing values, and seasonal distribution.
3. Compare yield and profitability across seasons.
4. Examine rainfall and temperature patterns and their relationship with yield.
5. Compare water efficiency and disease/pest risk across seasons.
6. Analyze the interaction between **irrigation method × season**.
7. Summarize the findings into practical agricultural recommendations.

## 💡 Key Findings

Based on the dataset used in the project:

- **Kharif** has the highest average yield and average profit among the three seasons.
- **Zaid** has the lowest average yield and the only negative average profit of the three seasons.
- **Kharif** has the highest average rainfall and relatively warm temperatures, while **Zaid** has the highest average temperature.
- **Kharif** also has the highest average disease/pest risk; **Zaid** has the lowest average disease/pest risk.
- **Rainfed** has the highest overall average water-efficiency value in this dataset, followed by **Drip**, **Sprinkler**, and **Flood**. This is an observed dataset result and should not be interpreted as a general agricultural rule.
- Across all irrigation methods, **Flood** has the lowest average water efficiency.
